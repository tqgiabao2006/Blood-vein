## 🚀 Game Overview  
*Blood Vein* is a **resource management simulation** where you design a **vascular network** to efficiently distribute mining cars underwater. With **Game AI, multi-threading, and procedural generation**, experience the challenge of optimizing pathways using **A* pathfinding and ECS-based logic**.

### 🎯 Key Features
- 🏗 **Vascular Road System** – Design organic road networks like blood veins.  
- 🤖 **AI-driven Pathfinding** – Uses **A* algorithm** for vehicle navigation.  
- ⚙️ **Procedural Mesh Generation** – Dynamic road structures adapt to player design.  
- 🔀 **Multi-threading with ECS** – Performance-optimized simulation.  
- 🎨 **Stylized Visuals** – Unique underwater city aesthetic.
